# Moving Blocks

## Description
This is an animation project using css keyframes to move four blocks to each corner of a container. The animations ease-in-out until they reach the end of a line of travel, at which they immediately disappear, then reappear within the same time interval as their travel time.

## How To Run
Fork the repository, clone it to your machine, and drag the index.html file into your browser window. You can also see the project [here](https://moving-blocks.vercel.app/), published through Vercel.
